# household-task-manager-rails
This is my Ruby on Rails project for the Full Stack Web Developer course at the Flatiron School. This web application will be the same as my Sinatra project, except it uses the Rails framework. It is a task manager that helps a household create and manage tasks and subtasks. 


OVERVIEW
I took a long hiatus after getting through the materials on Rails (around 1.5 months) before getting back to the portfolio project for this section. This bit will document how I decided to approach getting my head back into the work knowing that I will have more dedicated but still sporadic time to spend on completing this project. I'm using this as to track my work patterns more realistically and with more "mindful awareness" so I can make better future coursework/project plans. I don't want to pressure or rush myself, so I will just document activities on a day-to-day basis.

10/3/20
- reviewed the project requirements
- set up the github repo and generated new rails app
- made the decision to make the same web app as my Sinatra project since it meets the project scope


10/7/20
- added in raw code from models/controllers/views/migrations for user from Sinatra project
- added in sessions/cookies/omniauth code from rails labs
(Still need to be cleaned up,tailored, debugged, and refactored)
